Hey, thanks for stopping in. My name's Nate. I'm
a Senior Systems Architect over at [TechEmpower](https://www.techempower.com).
You may know us as the folks that do the [Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/).
In case I say anything stupid in the future, let's make it **clear** that
this blog isn't affiliated with my employer and that I say stupid things
by my own volition.

I'm starting this blog mainly because I learn and remember things better
when I'm explaining them to someone else, or at the very least, when I'm 
writing them down. I don't consider myself a *subject matter expert* at any
one thing, but there are lots of things in my line of work I do enjoy, much to
the distress of some around me.

If we've talked tech at all, you know I'm a big fan of [React](https://reactjs.org/).
I don't think I really enjoyed frontend web development until React came along.
I imagine I'll be writing a lot of posts about React and JavaScript. Where I
work, I have the pleasure *(and it really is a pleasure)* of working with
several different technologies. I do a lot of work on TechEmpower's Framework
Benchmarks. In fact, sometimes the quickest way to get a hold of me is in the
[pull requests](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/pulls) there.
I also do a lot of cloud infrastructure work. Lately, I've been taking some deep
dives into security and am studying for the Certified Ethical Hacking (CEH) exam
so expect to be spammed with some posts to help me remember what I'm learning there.

Some other things you may see blog posts about include poker, baseball, investing
*(how to do it poorly)*, health *(how to do it poorly)*, etc. Since I rage over
politics daily, I'll probably stay away from that here, but that's not a promise.

Mostly, this is a place where I can look at an archive of my bad ideas and
opinions and see how just how much I've grown. I plan on having some pretty bad
opinions, corny blog posts, and being categorically wrong sometimes. When that
happens, feel free to [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/natebrady23) and I'll make
sure to stand my ground.

## Housekeeping

There are a few things on my ToDo list for the blog, like trying out a few
different static site generators, code highlighting and better styling for some
of the markdown, adding tags for filtering posts, etc. If you notice any typos
or errors, feel free to reach out or head over to the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/nbrady-techempower/today-i-learned) and open an issue or
pull request. I ganked the style, but not the
[code](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io), for the blog from
Dan Abramov's [Overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io).
